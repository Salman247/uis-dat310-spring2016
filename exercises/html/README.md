## Exercise #3b: Advanced lists

Building on the previous exercise, make the following changes:

  - Use squares as list markers (instead of bullets) for the unordered list.
  - Use roman lowercase numbers for numbering the nested ordered list. 
  - Add another nested list under "Orange C", with three items (red, green, blue), numbered with uppercase letters. The numbering should start with "Z" and go in descending order (Z, Y, X, ...).
  - See [this page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp) for how to change list markers.
  - See [this page](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp) for reference on ordered lists.
