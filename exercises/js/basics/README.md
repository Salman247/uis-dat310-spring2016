# JavaScript exercises, Part I. (basics)

## Exercise #1: Display options

Look at the different display examples and execute them by opening the files on your local computer.

  - [Writing into the browser console](/examples/js/basics/display_console.html)
  - [Writing into an alert box](/examples/js/basics/display_alert.html)
  - [Writing into the HTML output](/examples/js/basics/display_document.html)


## Exercise #2: Lucky number seven

  - Create a HTML page with a `<script>` block embedded in the `<head>`.
  - Write JS code that outputs the numbers from 1 to 10.
  - For the number 7 it should print the word "seven" instead.
  - Use the web developer console of the browser to see the results.

## Exercise #2b: Lucky number seven, with a list

  - Solve the previous exercise, but instead of writing the output to the browser console, display it as an unordered HTML list (using `document.write()`).
  - Embed the `<script>` block inside the `<body>`.
  - You need to create the entire list (including `<ul>` and `</ul>`) using JavaScript! In other words, there cannot be anything outside `<script>...</script>` in the body part of your document.
