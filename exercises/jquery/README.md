## Exercise #5: jQuery color picker

Solve the previous JavaScript exercise ([JS II / Exercise #8](../../solutions/js/events_dom/exercise8.js)) using jQuery.

  - Make a color picker that displays a color palette; display colored tiles (rectangles) in the "colors" div.
  - When a colored tile is clicked:
    * write the code of that color inside the "selected" div;
    * set the background of the "selected" div to that color.
  - You are given the [HTML file](exercise5.html) and [part of the JS code](exercise5.js) that collects the different colors in an array. (Only the JS file needs to be edited.)

## Exercise #6: Playlist

Solve the previous JavaScript exercise ([JS II / Exercise #7](../../solutions/js/events_dom/exercise7.js)) using jQuery.

  - Create a simple playlist application where users can add songs to a list. The song here is just a non-empty string.
  - The [starter HTML file](exercise6.html) contains the form and an empty playlist.  There is an [external CSS file](exercise6.css) with the style declarations.
  - Add your solution to [exercise6.js](exercise6.js). You are not allowed to make changes to the html file!

## Exercise #7: Input check

Solve the previous JavaScript exercise ([JS II / Exercise #5](../../solutions/js/events_dom/exercise7.js)) using jQuery.

  - You are [given a form](exercise7.html) with two password fields and a submit button.
  - Perform input check and display an error message next the the corresponding field if there is an error.
    * Passwords must be at least 6 characters long.
    * The two passwords must match.
  - The placeholders for the error messages have already been prepared (div-s with class "err").
  - By default the submit button should be hidden. Display the button only when there are no errors.
