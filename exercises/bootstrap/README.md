# Bootstrap exercises

## Exercise #1: 960.gs

This is not an exercise about Bootstrap (yet).

Complete [exercise1.html](exercise1.html) such that that page displays as shown below:

You need to create the boxes using the prepared CSS classes. See [this page](http://960.gs/demo.html) for an example.

Hint: the first (blue) box becomes:

```html
<div class="grid_6"> 
  <div class="blue"></div> 
</div>
```

## Exercise #2: Grid layout

Complete [exercise2.html](exercise2.html) to create the following layout using Bootstrap.  Start with the mobile view.

Hint: use [responsive classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities) on rows.
